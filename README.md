# Predicting-Credit-Card-Defaults-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of predicting credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. The research explores logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes classifiers on a dataset containing credit card transaction and payment behavior. The study aims to assist financial institutions in credit risk assessment by developing predictive models that analyze key features related to credit card usage.

# Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations <br>
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering <br>
Implementation of Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes models <br>
Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score <br>
Comparison of models for predictive effectiveness <br>

#Dataset
The dataset used for this study was sourced from Kaggle and contains credit card usage and payment behavior data. It includes various attributes such as:

Demographic details (age, gender, marital status, education level)<br>
Financial data (credit limit, bill amounts, previous payments)<br>
Payment history (delinquency records over six months)<br>

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand the dataset‚Äôs distribution and identify important features. Key insights include:

Class Imbalance: Majority of users do not default, leading to imbalance in labels. <br>
Feature Correlation: Payment history and credit utilization significantly impact default prediction. <br>

# Models Implemented
Two machine learning models were used:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression: A linear classification model effective for binary classification tasks. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Na√Øve Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic classifier that assumes independence among features. <br>

# Conclusion
This research demonstrates that Logistic Regression is an effective model for predicting credit card defaults. The findings emphasize the importance of payment history and credit utilization in risk assessment. This work can help financial institutions improve risk management strategies.

### Performance Comparison
